The complete front-end for the library system backend built on node.js, and my first "real" React project.
I put together something rather simple as a display for the backend. I used this to get an idea of what writing React code is like.

I hate it.

But it was a good learning experience. I'll definitely be doing it again because I am addicted to torture. And I think a lot of the hate comes from unfamiliarity. So we'll see how I'm feeling after my next big project.

Like I said, this is the first time I've made a front-end project, and I'm aware there's probably a hilarious amount of things I did wrong, so if you have any feedback, I'd love to hear it.
